            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p class="resume-design text-box-1">Hi there! My name is Ryan Sandison. I am a nineteen year old lad from wellingborough northamptonshire. I am a student and the University of Northampton, currently studying on the first year of my Computer Game Development at BSc(Hons). My goal while at University is to take the necessary knowledge to kick start a successful career in the games industry, and then be able to apply that knowledge into the real world.</p>

            <h2>What do I do?</h2>
            <p class="resume-design text-box-2">Although i have been studying and doing assignment work for the University, I have also been undertaking some projects of my own. One example of this is my game demo, although small I feel it shows what I can do if I put my mind to it. I made the game demo in a couple of hours while sat in the cafe at the University. I hope to expand this demp in the future and make it into a full fledged game, with items, more than one enemy and more levels. </p>
