I am a student at the University of Northampton, currently studying on the first year of my Computer Game Development at BSc(Hons).

          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
          <p class="resume-design">My main hobby would have to be gaming! 100% when im not working or doing course work then I will be playing games. My most played game would be League of Legends. I think i enjoy it most because its a very competitve game that tests the players skill.           When im not playing games, I enjoy programming in my spare time, weather this be for a game im making or my website, i enjoy it all! </p>
