This was the first commit I made to github for this assignment. This commit was done using a version of Ottergram (a test website being made in class) This site was simply so I could see what would happen when I committed. In this version of the website i had some images, some text and a navigation bar that was semi working. The colours used were temporary and were changed with the next commit.

This was the second commit i did to github, in this commit i removed the otters from the site and was left with just blank pages and the nav bar. Here i was trying to adapt what i had already(the css) so that i could save some time later on. however this would not end up working correctly and in the next commit i would got to add and change the css some more.

The third commit for this day was focusing on adding some assignment related text to the index page, including a download link for my 2d game demo. I also changed the css a little more, adding some padding and a site wrapper.

In this commit i started adding some styling to the overall site, some colours and also images from my game for the index page. I also added Javascript, but found out after that we cannot use js, so that is removed in a future commit.

this was a small commit that only changed some of the styling, ie padding, margin etc, i wanted to make the site look cleaner and this was how, by making a home style for the pages.

In this commit I only removed the JS from the site.

The first 3 commits on this day were all to fix an error i had, this error came about from having two different versions of the site, on my desktop pc and one on my laptop. to fix this is deleted one of the sites and then re-uploaded it so that the final versions were the same.

13 January 2016
in this commit i uploaded some of my README and also removed the js from the re-uploaded old site. This means now i have my final site done and just need to upload this README.
overall i have spent about 17 hours on this site and i think it has come together nice.

while making this website i have used a number of tutorials found on both YouTube and w3. I have also had help from my tutors and classmates.
